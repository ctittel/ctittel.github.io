◊h2{About Me}
Hi, my name is Christoph Tittel. I'm currently a Researcher at the Plan-Based Robotics group at DFKI (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence).
I received a Master of Science from the Technical University of Munich in ◊i{Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence}, an interdisciplinary program offered by the departments of Informatics, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, but focused mostly on computer science side of things. Before that I received a Bachelors from Nuremberg Institute of Technology in Mechatronics. My Bachelor studies were organized in the format of a dual studies program (◊i{Verbundstudium}) in cooperation with Siemens and included a practical training and internships at Siemens.
