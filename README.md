Personal website, made with Racket / Pollen

## Racket commands cheat sheet
- Rendering everything: `raco pollen render -p` (`-p` for multiprocessing)
- `raco pollen publish <source> <dest>` to copy all files not specific to Racket/Pollen to `<dest>`
- DEBUG mode: set the env variable `DEBUG` to use local paths (for testing / debugging)
