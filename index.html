<root><h2>About Me</h2>
<p class="blocktext">Hi, my name is Christoph Tittel. I'm currently a Researcher at the <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/plan-based-robot-control/">Plan-Based Robot Control group (PBR)</a> at DFKI (<i>German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence</i>).
I received a Master of Science from the Technical University of Munich in <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/robotics-cognition-intelligence-master-of-science-msc/">Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence</a>, a joint program offered by the departments of Informatics, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.
As the name of the program might suggest, it was focused primarily on the computer science side of things.
Before that, I received a Bachelor's in Mechatronics from Nuremberg Institute of Technology. My Bachelor studies were organized in the form of a dual studies program (<i>Verbundstudium</i>) in cooperation with Siemens and included a practical training and internships at Siemens.
I grew up on a farm in a tiny village in the middle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia">Franconia</a>, the northern part of Bavaria.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
This is a list of some of my current interests (there are more, of course). I do not claim to be an expert in anything. But I find these fields interesting and think that they are important:
<ul><li><b>Artificial Intelligence</b>: Currently, I prefer AI approaches which make no "explicit" use of statistics. My current belief is that the most promising approach towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a> is the combination of a Machine Learning approach like Deep Learning plus some sort of genetic approach like <a href="https://www.genetic-programming.org/">Genetic Programming</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_design">Information Design</a></b>: Information Design wants to answer the question of how we can present information (mostly visual information like text and images) so that it can be absorbed as easily as possible by other humans, taking human psychology and cognition into account. A prominent contributor to the field is Edward Tufte, who describes many <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">interesting insights</a> about information design. A good showcase for Information Design, and an easy and quick way to use the results of the field in a website, is <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">tufte-css</a>.</li>
<li><b>Programming Languages</b>: I enjoy learning about new programming languages and how they compare to existing ones. Also, I am curious towards which programming languages humanity will "converge" in the long term. A factor that is seemingly often underestimated in the design of programming languages is their UX and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_programming">Psychology of Programming</a>.</li></ul>
